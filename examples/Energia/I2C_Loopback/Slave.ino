 * DWire: a library to provide full hardware-driven I2C functionality

 * this library in Energia (the Arduino port for MSP microcontrollers)
 * or in other toolchains.
 *
 * The example code in this file demonstrates the use of DWire in
 * loopback with both a master and a slave. Pin P6.5 (SCL) should be 
 * connected to P1.7 and with a pull-up (3k3) to Vcc. Pin P6.4 (SDA) 
 * should be connected to P1.6 and with a pull-up (3k3) to Vcc.
